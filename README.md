# PWC-PowerBI-Virtual-Internship-Forage
This repository showcases the work I completed during the PwC Virtual Internship at Forage, where I utilized Power BI to analyze and visualize business data. Throughout the internship, I developed skills in data transformation, report creation, and interactive dashboards, focusing on providing actionable insights through data visualization.

This project serves as a demonstration of my ability to work with business data and communicate insights through compelling, interactive visualizations. You can explore the reports, dashboards, and the underlying Power BI file (.pbix) to see my approach and results.
