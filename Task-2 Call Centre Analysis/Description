This project demonstrates the creation of an interactive Power BI dashboard to analyze and visualize key performance indicators (KPIs) for a call centerâ€™s customer service department. The objective of this dashboard is to provide meaningful insights into customer satisfaction, agent performance, and call handling efficiency.

Key components of the dashboard include:

Overall Customer Satisfaction: A metric to measure how satisfied customers are with the service, derived from survey data or feedback scores.

Call Handling Metrics:

Total Calls Answered vs Abandoned: Visualizations to compare answered calls with abandoned calls, helping the company identify potential service gaps.

Calls by Time: A time-based analysis showing when the peak times for customer calls occur. This insight is critical for staffing and optimizing resource allocation.

Average Speed of Answer (ASA): This KPI measures how quickly agents respond to customer calls. The goal is to minimize the ASA to improve customer experience.

Agent Performance Quadrant: A performance quadrant that compares agents based on two key factors:

Average Handle Time (AHT): The average duration of calls handled by an agent.

Calls Answered: The number of calls an agent successfully answers. The quadrant allows the identification of high-performing agents versus those needing improvement.

Project Insights:
The dashboard helps managers identify trends in customer service performance, pinpoint peak call times, and assess how well agents are handling customer inquiries.

By monitoring these KPIs, the company can adjust staffing levels, improve customer service training, and enhance overall customer experience.

Visualizations are built to be user-friendly and interactive, enabling stakeholders to explore the data and drill down into specifics as needed.
