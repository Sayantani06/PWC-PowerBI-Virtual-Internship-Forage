Project Insights:

The dashboard helps the HR department track gender balance across key metrics such as promotions, turnover, and hiring patterns.

It highlights that, despite a higher percentage of female hires in FY20, fewer women were promoted compared to men,
signaling potential gaps in career advancement for women.

By analyzing average performance ratings, the dashboard shows that the difference between male and female ratings is minimal 
but could point to trends that need further investigation.

Underrepresentation of Women in Leadership Roles: The dashboard also reveals that there are fewer women in leadership roles within the company.
Despite similar hire rates, women are underrepresented in higher-level positions, which signals the need for targeted strategies to promote gender balance at the
leadership level.

HR teams can use this data to tailor diversity and inclusion strategies, such as offering additional support for women to progress into 
leadership positions and ensuring that leadership opportunities are equally accessible to all employees.

This dashboard provides clear, actionable insights to guide the telecom companyâ€™s diversity initiatives and help improve gender equality 
at the executive management level.
